## I. Introduction
The name *MOJITO* stands for materials project on analyzing spectroscopy. Though this abbreviation might not be favourable to everyone, this project is actually aiming to solve the problems of analyzing spectrums for anyone who works in materials science and related areas.

To begin with, let's consider some useful characterization techniques that we use in these areas. The first few ones that come up to me are X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence, and these will be the starting point of our project.

To under stand why the characterization results come in the form that we see. The first thing we need to do is to figure out how light is interacting with our materials. So, we will first talk about the mechanism of interaction between light and our materials.

## II. Interactions Between Electromagnetic Radiation and Materials
In this part, we are going to talk about the interactions between light and materials. This will give us a glimpse on the origin of the shape of spectrums that we can get from characterizations. The first thing that we will talk about in this section, is broadening. 

### A. Natural Line Broadening （自然致宽）
The origin of natrual line broadening is the energy-time uncertainty principle （能量-时间不确定性原理）. Let's consider a scene of a light is exciting electrons to higher states.

### B. Doppler Broadening （多普勒致宽）

### C. Pressure Broadening （压力致宽）

### D. Power, or saturation, broadening （功率，或饱和致宽）

## III. Principles of Characterization Techniques
In this part, we will have a deep look at the working principles of the characterization we usually carry out in materials science and related areas. To fully understand our testing results, knowing only the mechanism dicting the interactions between light and materials is insufficient. The situation changes from time to time as we always try to characterize our device from different perspectives. Ignoring other factors will only give you a spherical chicken in vacuum （真空中的球形鸡）. There is actually far more profound knowledge driving the real world we live in. So, let's take a look at the common characterization methods we used. 
### A. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
### B. Raman
### C. UV-vis Absorption and Photoluminescence
