# MOJITO
Materials prOJect on analyzIng specTrOscopy

# I. Introduction
The name MOJITO stands for materials project on analyzing spectroscopy. Though this abbreviation might not be favourable to everyone, this project is actually aiming to solve the problems of analyzing spectrums for anyone who works in materials science and related areas.

To begin with, let's consider some useful characterization techniques that we use in these areas. The first few ones that come up to me are X-ray Diffraction, Raman, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence, and these will be the starting point of our project.
